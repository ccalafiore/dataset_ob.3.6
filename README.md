# dataset_ob.3.6

This project stores the small and blurred version of the dataset of multi-view videos of human actions (MVVHAs). MVVHAs is a dataset of multi-view videos (MVV).
In this small vertion, each MVV has 24 (8 x 3) Single-View Videos (SVVs) showing the same action from 24 differnt viewpoints. In this version, all images were blurred.


This version of the MVVHAs was designed for my online psychology experiments that are listed at [https://ccalafiore.github.io](https://ccalafiore.github.io).
The small and clear (non-blurred) version can be found at [https://github.com/ccalafiore/dataset_o.3.6](https://github.com/ccalafiore/dataset_o.3.6).
The big version of the dataset for deep learning experiments needs to be requested.
